# Juno Apps
 My projects for the [Juno College JavaScript Course](https://github.com/HackerYou/con-ed-javascript)


 + **JunoTweet** > a basic Twitter type app to demonstrate the use of JQuery.

 ### About this App
 This app tries to demonstrate a basic use of jQuery to interact with the DOM in response to a user interacting with the page. The app should do the following:

 + Prompt you for your username
 + Allow you start tweeting
 + Display the tweets in a list of Recent tweets
 + "Like" a tweet
 + "Retweet" or "Unretweet" a tweet
 + Delete a tweet

 The avatar that is generated for the user uses the @username to generate a custom icon. The tweets get a timestamp when created. Animations for adding and removing occur.
